# Card

This section shows all of the possible actions that can be performed with a card, including labelling, notifications and extensive tutorial on description text editor. 

Card represents individual task, e.g. "Go buy groceries" or "Fix the wrong button placement".

## Creating, moving and deleting cards

To create a card you have two options:
1. Click on the `+ Add Card` button at the bottom of an existing list. 
2. Click the `ellipsis` icon at the top-right of the list and select `Add Card`. It will create card at the bottom of the list.

After you write the title of the card, press `Enter` or "Add card" button to create it; alternatively, you can press `Ctrl` + `Enter` combination to create the card and immidiately open it. To abort creating a new card, press `Cancel` or click in an empty spot on the board (this option will not work if you have filled the title; in that case, click the `Cancel` button).

The easiest way to move cards across the board is to drag and drop it in the desired place - just click and hold it! You can put card in both open and hidden lists. When dropping to the hidden list, it will be placed at the bottom of this list. To be sure which hidden list are you putting your card into, look if the title is pushed lower. In the example below, the card will be stored in "To test" list.

There are two other ways to move a card: with card menu (see below) and in the card view, right below the title (see Card options).

To delete the card, you have to move your mouse above the card you want to delete. After that, a three dot icon will appear. Click on it to open a card menu and select `Delete Card`.

## Card menu

![card_menu.png](../cardmenu_en.png) 

After clicking the three dots in the card you will open a card menu. Here you can:
1. Edit the name of the card
2. Assing members to the card (see Card Options below)
3. Add/remove labels to the card (see Card Options below)
4. Edit due date of the card (see Card Options below)
5. Edit timer of the card (see Card Options below)
6. Move card to another project/board/list (note that this is the only way to move the card to another project or board, as drag & dropping the card works only on the lists in a current board).
7. Duplicate card, which will create exact same copy of the card directly below it in the list
8. Delete card
## Card View overview
When you click on the card, the card view will show up at the right side of your screen. Why not on the centre? The unique feature of 4ga Boards is that you can manipulate the lists and boards while the card view is open.

The working view should look like this (notice the yellow text local changes - it shows that the text is still in edit mode and the changes are not yet registered on the server):
