## Preferences
This section lets you customize 4ga Boards to your, well, preferences.

![User preferences settings](/img/settingspreferences_en.png)

1. "Subscribe to my own cards": set if you want to be automatically subscribed to the cards created by you (see [card](./card#card-options), card options section).

2. "Compact Sidebar": choose the style of your sidebar (applicable for both settings and board sidebars). 
If you enable it, you sidebar will be slim. This option is great if you prefer minimalistic design and more room for your lists in the board view.

If you disable it, the sidebar will be bulkier, which might be useful if you have long project names.
