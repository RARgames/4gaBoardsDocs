# Structure
This section aims to present the logical structure of organizing the workflow with 4ga Boards.

4ga Boards is using a four-level structure to help you maintain even the most complicated projects. Speaking of projects...

[Project](./project) is a highest level of organization in 4ga Boards, a container holding boards.\
[Board](./board) is a workspace within a project where tasks are organized through lists.\
[List](./list) is a column on the board representing different stages or categories of the workflow (e.g. "To Do", "Doing"), with tasks attached to it.\
[Card](./card) is representing individual task (with optional subtasks) that can be moved across lists.

Each of the levels is thoroughly explained in the respective sections.

[Sidebar](./sidebar) allows for efficient management of 4ga Boards program elements.
