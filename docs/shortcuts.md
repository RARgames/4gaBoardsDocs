This page presents shortcuts that helps you use 4ga Boards more effectively.

`Ctrl` + `Enter`

Use it to quickly save text changes, e.g. while editing description, comments or adding a task. If you use it while creating a new card it will automatically open card view. 

`Shift` + `Scroll`

Hold shift to scroll across the board horizontally. Very useful when a board has a lot of lists that don't fit in the browser window.
