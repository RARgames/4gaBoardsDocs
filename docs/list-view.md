# List View

List View is a special view in 4ga Boards that lets you see all your tasks in a convenient to-do list style. Both views are interchangeable — all changes stay in sync, whether you make them in the board or list view.

## List view navigation

You can adjust the column width manually by dragging the `|` separators.

Each row represents a separate card and includes all the same features as a regular card in the board view, displayed in columns.
From left to right:
1. `Bell` icon for notifications
2. Card name
3. Labels attached to the card
4. Members attached to the card
5. List in the board view where the card belongs
6. `Tick` indicating whether a description is present
7. Number of attachments
8. Number of comments
9. Due date
10. Earliest due date
11. Timer
12. Tasks attached to the card
13. `Ellipsis` menu of the card.

For additional info, please refer to [Card description](./card).

You can interact with each of them directly form the list view or by opening the appriopriate card. To do this, click on an empty spot in a card row (for ease of navigation, we recommend clicking on the description/attachment/comment field - they will not open a popup window).

This is the default column selection. To add or remove columns, use the `Ellipsis` menu in the top-right corner of the list. You can also set columns to adjust to the content or screen, and easily reset sorting and column selection to their default values.

At the bottom of the list is another navigation pane, in which you can select how many cards are visible per page (default: 100), change pages with the arrows on the left and access list menu with the `cog` icon. On the right side you can add [List](./list) and [Card](./card) - they will also appear on the board view.

## List view features

Compared to a classic board view, there are a few special options which helps visualise your workflow better:

Sorting - you can sort your list just like a regular table, in both ascending and descending order, indicated with `Arrow` icon.

You can perform a multilayered sorting - choose multiple columns to sort with, with the numbers indicating the priority. In the example below, the sorting order is as follows: labels ascending, then name descending.
