When you choose the project you have options to change the title (click `Save` button to save changes),add or remove managers from the project and set the background image (with possibility to upload your own). The image will be visible in [projects view](./project). For extra caution, the `Delete Project` button was situated in the `Danger Zone`. And no worries, we added an additional pop-up for confirmation.
